## Critical Learnings

### Session 1
**Asset:** Serum Bot (Refinement)
**Learning:** "The previous asset was a primitive collection of shapes that lacked the 'oppressive weight' of the Scrapyard. 16-bit constraints require using density of detail to convey mass, not just size."
**Action:** "Replaced primitive shapes with a voxel-style assembly of `<rect>` elements to simulate a pixel-art sprite. Enforced integer coordinates to align with the 'Grid is Law' philosophy."
