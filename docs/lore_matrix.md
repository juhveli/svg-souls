# Lore Delivery Matrix: The Chronocrystal Empire

This document explicitly defines *how* the player learns the history of the world without being told a cutscene. We use "Show, Don't Tell" and "Item Archeology".

## I. Environmental Storytelling (The "Show")

| Location | Visual Element | Lore Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Scrapyard** | Mountains of discarded, smooth glass limbs mixed with gears. | The "lower class" were prototypes. Imperfect glass was thrown away. You (The Soft One) woke up here. |
| **The Cathedral of Ticks** | A massive stained-glass window depicting a figure stopping a pendulum. The glass of the figure is cracked. | The "Architect" tried to stop time but failed. The crack represents the "Shatter". |
| **The Frozen Plaza** | Citizens frozen in mid-dance, their bodies shattered but suspended in the air. | The "Shatter" happened instantly during a celebration. Time is broken locally here. |

## II. Item Archaeology (The "Read")

### 1. Consumable: *Vial of Liquid Seconds*
> *A small glass vial containing a golden, viscous fluid that twitches on its own.*
> *Restores health by rewinding the body's timeline slightly.*
> *"The rich drank time like wine, believing it would keep their glass skins from growing dull. They did not know that hoarding time leaves none for the rest of the world."*

### 2. Weapon: *Tuning Fork Greatsword*
> *A massive, two-pronged blade made of heavy iron. Vibrates violently upon impact.*
> *"Standard issue for the Silence Guard. While the glass nobility sought perfect pitch, the guards were tasked with 'dampening' dissonance—usually by crushing the source."*

### 3. Key Item: *The Stopped Watch*
> *A pocket watch with hands fused to the face. It feels impossibly heavy.*
> *"A keepsake of the Architect. It is said he stared at this watch for so long he forgot to wind the heavy heart of the world. Or perhaps, he chose not to."*

## III. Boss Design (The "Fight")

### Boss: *The Glass-Blower Deity*
*   **Arena:** A furnace room where the heat is intense (visual distortion).
*   **Visual Design:** A giant, bloated figure made of molten, glowing glass. He is constantly "exhaling" to keep his shape.
*   **Mechanic:** He blows "bubbles" of glass that trap you. You must break them before they cool and harden (instant kill).
*   **Lore Hook:** He was the one who made the bodies for the nobility. Now, in his madness, he is trying to blow a "New World," but his breath is too hot, and everything he makes melts.
*   **Soul Drop:** *Breath of the Creator.* ("He gave his breath to make them beautiful, but he had no breath left to tell them they were fragile.")

## IV. NPC Interaction
*   **Character:** *Tick-Tock, the Broken Bard*
*   **Location:** Sitting on a giant cog, tapping a rhythm on his glass knee.
*   **Dialogue 1:** "One, two. One, two. You're off beat, little soft one. Squishy. Quiet. Disgusting."
*   **Dialogue 2:** "They say the Carillon will ring again. But I like the quiet between the ticks. That's where the music lives using the rests."
