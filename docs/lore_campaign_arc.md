## II. The Threat Layering

1.  **Layer 1 (Physical):** The monsters and robots (Fractured/Gear-Keepers). They just want to kill you.
2.  **Layer 2 (Political):** The Architect vs. The Silence. A war of ideologies (Order vs. Entropy).
3.  **Layer 3 (Cosmic/Secret):** The Void. Azathoth. The realization that the entire song is a defense mechanism against a sleeping god.

## III. The Twist
The Architect isn't the villain. He is the *Warden*. He locked the universe in a loop to keep **Azathoth** asleep. The Echo Walker, by waking the world up, risks waking the monster.
