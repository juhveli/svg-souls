# Level Design: Area 3 - The Clockwork Arteries
**Role:** The Machine / Rhythm & Oppression
**Theme:** Heat, Industrial Noise, Blind Obedience
**Key Mechanic:** Rhythm-Action & Heat Management

## 1. Zone Overview
We descend from the beautiful Glass Gardens into the sweating, ticking heart of the world.
*   **Visual Style:** Brass, steam, lava-like "Liquid Time" flowing in pipes. Darker, grittier, and claustrophobic.
*   **Audio:** The "Heartbeat" of the world is loud here. 4/4 industrial techno woven into the ambient noise of pistons.

### 1.1 Lore Connectivity (The Dying Host)
This area is suffering to keep the Gardens alive.
*   **The Overheat:** The "Red Zones" are not natural; they are areas where the coolant was diverted to the Upper City.
*   **The Sabotage:** You will find "Golden Wire" jammed into gears. The **Silence Guard** (from Area 4) has been sneaking down here to stop the machine, while the Gardens drain it dry. The Gear-Keepers are fighting a war on two fronts.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1 The Beat of the Machine (Active Storytelling)
The level itself is an instrument.
*   **Hazards:** Steam vents and crushers fire *exactly* on the beat of the background music.
*   **Narrative Integration:** The enemies (Gear-Keepers) chant in time with the pistons ("Work. Click. Turn. Click."). If the player attacks *off-beat*, the enemies block more effectively.

### 2.2 Overheat
*   **Mechanic:** Some rooms are so hot that your "Damping" suit starts to stiffen.
*   **Effect:** You have a "Heat Bar". If it fills, you cannot use *Dampen* (Sneak) or *Refract* (Dash). Standing in "Coolant Showers" (waterfalls from the gardens above) resets it.

## 3. Enemies & Barks

### Enemy: The Stoker-Drone
*   **Behavior:** Shovels raw time crystals into furnaces. Ignores player until provoked.
*   **Bark Triggers:**
    *   *Idle:* "Feed the heart... feed the heart..."
    *   *On Aggro:* "Impurity detected! Burn it out!"
    *   *Death:* "Cold... so cold..."

### Enemy: The Metronome Sentry (Elite)
*   **Behavior:** A four-legged walker that stomps on quarter notes. Creates a shockwave on every crash.
*   **Bark Triggers:**
    *   *Attack:* "ONE. TWO. THREE. CRUSH." (He actually counts certain attacks).

## 4. The Boss: The Metronome General
**Lore:** The commander of the Gear-Keepers. He believes the "Shatter" happened because the world lost its rhythm. He is trying to force the world back into sync by beating it into submission.
*   **Arena:** A giant clock face that rotates.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   *Phase 1 (The conductor):* He stands in the middle. Attacks spin like clock hands. You must jump over the "Minute Hand" (Fast) and duck under the "Hour Hand" (Slow).
    *   *Phase 2 (Tempo Change):* The music speeds up (Tempo increases). The boss attacks faster. The "Beat" becomes frantic.
    *   *The Twist:* You must *break* his rhythm (parry off-beat) to stagger him.
*   **Reward:** *The Syncopated Gear*. Allows you to "freeze" moving platforms for 2 seconds.

## 5. Narrative Progression
*   **Entrance:** You fall through a ventilation shaft from the Glass Gardens (showing the literal "Trash/Treasure" relationship).
*   **Mid-Point:** The massive "Ticking Heart" of the world. It is skipping beats.
*   **Exit:** You realize the Heart isn't broken; it's being *strangled* by silence coming from above. You must ascend the central shaft to **Area 4: The Silent Spire**.
