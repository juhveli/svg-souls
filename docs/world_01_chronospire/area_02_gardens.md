# Level Design: Area 2 - The Glass Gardens
**Role:** The City / Beauty & Horror
**Theme:** Vanity, Reflection, Invisible Threats
**Key Mechanic:** Light & Mirrors

## 1. Zone Overview
After the rusty darkness of The Scrapyard, this area is blindingly bright. It is a city of high spires, greenhouses, and ballrooms, all constructed of prisms.
*   **Visual Style:** Rainbows everywhere. White marble and clear glass.
*   **Audio:** High-pitched, crystalline wind chimes. The sound of glass cracking underfoot.

### 1.1 Lore Connectivity (The Parasite)
The beauty here is stolen.
*   **From Below (Area 3):** Massive heat-pipes run up the sides of the spires. The Gardens drain 90% of the world's power to keep the "Artificial Sun" shining.
*   **From Below (Area 1):** The "Soil" in the gardens is composted scrap from Area 1. The Glazewrights believe that "Trash must be refined into Art," literally growing flowers out of the rusted corpses of their failures.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1 The Reflection Truth (Active Storytelling)
*   **Mechanic:** Large mirrors are placed throughout the level.
*   **The Stick:** Some enemies (**Vanity Wraiths**) are invisible to the naked eye but visible in mirrors. You must fight them by watching the reflection, not your character.
*   **The Carrot:** Mirrors show the "Golden Age" version of the room.
    *   *Real World:* A ruined hallway with corpses.
    *   *Reflection:* A pristine ballroom with dancers waltzing to music.

### 2.2 Light-Walking
*   **Mechanic:** Using the *Refract* ability (unlocked here), the player can dissolve into light to travel along "Hard Light Bridges."
*   **Puzzle:** You must rotate prisms to connect bridges, but doing so sometimes shines light on "sleeping" enemies, waking them up.

## 3. Enemies & Barks

### Enemy: The Porcelain Dancer
*   **Behavior:** Fast, spinning attacks.
*   **Bark Triggers:**
    *   *Idle:* "Step, turn, kick... keep smiling..."
    *   *On Hit:* "Don't look at me! I'm hideous!"
    *   *Death:* "The music... finally stops."

### Enemy: The Prism-Guard
*   **Behavior:** Heavy shield made of light.
*   **Bark Triggers:**
    *   *On Block:* "Perfection cannot be scratched!"
    *   *Shield Break:* "My reflection... broken?"

## 4. The Boss: Narcissus, the Shattered Idol
**Lore:** The most beautiful of the Glazewrights, who stared into the Prismatic Core for so long his face became a mirror.
*   **Arena:** A Hall of Mirrors.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   *Phase 1 (The Illusion):* He creates 5 copies of himself. You must hit the one that *doesn't* have a reflection.
    *   *Phase 2 (The Shatter):* He breaks all mirrors. Shards fall continuously (Bullet Hell). He screams, "LOOK AT ME!" dealing AoE damage if you are facing him.
*   **Reward:** *The Prismatic Lens*. Allows you to see invisible bridges without mirrors.

## 5. Narrative Progression
*   **Entrance:** You arrive via elevator not to a city gate, but to a "Dressing Room." The city was a stage.
*   **Mid-Point:** You find the **Opera House**. The audience is petrified glass. A single conductor keeps waiving a baton at an empty stage.
*   **Exit:** You realize the "light" powering the city is heat leaking from the mechanism below. You must descend into **Area 3: The Clockwork Arteries**.
