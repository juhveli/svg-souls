# Level Design: Area 1 - The Scrapyard of Seconds
**Role:** Tutorial / Narrative Hook
**Theme:** Discarded Time, Broken Prototypes, Rust & Glass

## 1. Zone Overview
The bottom of the world. A graveyard of rejected moments. Here, the "Time is Sound" law manifests as decay: the rust on the gears is actually "oxidized time," a physical manifestation of seconds that were never allowed to pass.
*   **Atmosphere:** Lonely, metallic, dripping. The air is thick with the dust of ground-down seconds. Audio is dominated by the sound of ticking that is *out of sync*—a heartbeat that is struggling to keep rhythm.

## 2. Progression & Tutorialization

### Phase 1: Awakening (Movement)
*   **Scene:** The player (The Soft One) pulls themselves out of a pile of mannequin parts.
*   **Mechanic:** Basic movement & Jump.
*   **Narrative Beat:** You pass a mirror. You have no reflection. You are the only thing in the room that doesn't shine.

### Phase 2: The First Obstacle (Resonance)
*   **Encounter:** A "Fractured Serum-Bot" banging its head against a wall. It blocks the path.
*   **Tutorial:** "Passive Dampening". The game teaches you that walking slowly = Silent. If you run, the bot hears you and attacks precisely on the "Tick" sound.
*   **Action:** You must *Dampen* (Sneak) past it or *Strike* it to gain your first 'Resonance'.

### Phase 3: The Hazard (Gravity/Time)
*   **Scene:** The "Heavy Room." A zone where a giant piston smashed the floor.
*   **Mechanic:** Time is slowed here. Your jump height is doubled, but you move slower.
*   **Lore Item:** *The Foreman's Ledger* -> "Batch 404. Too soft. They absorb the song. Discard immediately." (Reveals your origin).

## 3. Visual Storytelling (The "Ah-Ha" Moment)
At the midpoint, you climb out of the pit and see the sky for the first time.
*   **The Vista:** You see the **Grand Carillon** in the distance. It is frozen mid-ring. A giant crack runs down the center of the world.
*   **The Detail:** The sky isn't blue; it's a shattered dome with the void behind it.

## 4. NPC Interaction
*   **Character:** **Old Cog, the Retired Smith**
*   **Location:** Huddled near a dying furnace, trying to warm a piece of cold iron.
*   **Role:** The Tragic Mentor.
*   **Interaction:** He gives you *Old Cog's Oil* and some advice on surviving the rust.
*   **Fate:** When you return after defeating Golgotha, he is gone. Only a pile of rust remains.
*   **Future Shadow:** *Scribe Note:* The player will encounter a twisted, rusted "Shadow of Old Cog" in Area 4 (The Silent Spire), forced to fight the memory of their only friend.

## 5. The Boss: The Keeper of the Waste
**Lore:** The automaton tasked with crushing defective prototypes. It has gone rogue and is "hoarding" the soft parts to try and build itself a soul.
*   **Name:** **Scrap-Titan Golgotha**
*   **Appearance:** A massive ball of junk, gears, and glass arms. It has a "face" made of a stolen porcelain mask.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   *Phase 1:* Rolls around. You must "Parry" (Catch) him when he hits the wall to stun.
    *   *Phase 2:* He screams (Audio Shockwave). You must hide behind debris to avoid specific resonance damage.
*   **Reward:** *The Rusty Key-Hand*. Allows you to open "Maintenance Doors" (Shortcuts).

## 6. Exit to Hub
Beating Golgotha opens the elevator to **The Tuning Fork** (The Hub Area).
