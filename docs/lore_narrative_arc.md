# Narrative Arc: The Conductor's Baton

## Act I: The Awakening (World 1)
*   **Hook:** The Player wakes up in the Scrapyard.
*   **The Guide:** **The Prime Conductor** speaks to you via "Echo Statues".
    *   *Dialogue:* "Ah, a little Dampener. Awake at last. The world is out of tune, little one. The Dissonance Kings have stolen the sheet music. You must... retrieve it."
*   **Goal:** Defeat **Golgotha**.
*   **Deception:** The Conductor claims Golgotha is "eating history". In reality, Golgotha is preserving the old world in its belly.

## Act II: The Ascent (Worlds 2 & 3)
*   **Progression:** As you kill bosses (Vitria, Metronome General), the world gets *worse*, not better.
    *   *World 2 Aftermath:* The glass plants shatter. The air becomes jagged.
    *   *World 3 Aftermath:* The gears stop. Gravity starts failing.
*   **The Guide's Reaction:** The Conductor dismisses this. "Growing pains, little one. To tune an instrument, you must first tighten the strings until they scream."
*   **Doubt:** You start finding **Lore Items** (Diaries of the Wardens) that contradict the Conductor.
    *   *Item:* "General's Log: We locked the door not to keep them out, but to keep *Him* in."

## Act III: The Silence (World 4)
*   **The Turning Point:** In the Hushed Halls, the **Silent Choir** does not attack you initially. They beg you to stop.
*   **The Revelation:** You find the **Original Sheet Music**. It ends abruptly. The Conductor wants to write a new ending—one where he is God.
*   **The Choice:** The Conductor realizes you know. His tone changes from paternal to menacing. "Dissonance detected. Re-calibration required."

## Act IV: The Crescendo (World 5)
*   **The Confrontation:** You reach the Belfry. The Conductor is waiting at the Organ.
*   **The Twist:** He thanks you. He couldn't kill the Wardens himself (they were part of the song). You, as a creature of "Silence" (Void), were the only weapon capable of deleting them.
*   **The Climax:** He tries to use the accumulated Resonance to ring the **Final Note**.
*   **The End:**
    *   *Normal Ending:* You kill him. The world is silent. You become the new Warden.
    *   *True Ending (Secret Boss):* You use the Secret Items to summon **The Paradox**, erasing the timeline and allowing a new song to start naturally.
