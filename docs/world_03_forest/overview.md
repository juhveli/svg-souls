# World 3: The Hushed Forest
**Theme:** Absorption, Rust, Organic Decay, Muting.
**Core Concept:** Nature has reclaimed the machine. But this nature *eats* sound. The moss is rust; the trees are oxidized iron.

## Areas

### Area 1: The Whispering Woods
*   **Visuals:** Tall, iron trees with "leaves" made of soft lead.
*   **Mechanics:** **Stealth Mandatory**. The ground is covered in dry leaves that crunch (alerting enemies). You must walk on the "Moss" (Silence) patches.
*   **Lore:** The trees whisper the last words of those who died here.

### Area 2: The Mossy Ruins
*   **Visuals:** Old clocktowers overgrown with "Rust-Ivy."
*   **Mechanics:** **Decay**. Metal weapons degrade (lose damage) over time. You must find "Oil" to maintain them.
*   **Lore:** The Glazewrights tried to build here, but the forest ate their city.

### Area 3: The Resin Swamps
*   **Visuals:** Pools of amber that trap insects and time.
*   **Mechanics:** **Sticky Time**. If you stand still, you get stuck. You must keep moving.
*   **Lore:** The amber preserves things perfectly, but they are dead.

### Area 4: The Petrified Canopy
*   **Visuals:** High above the forest, where the trees turn to stone.
*   **Boss Arena:** A giant bird's nest made of clock hands.

## Bosses

### Sub-Boss: The Blight-Druid
*   **Lore:** A survivor who worships the Rust. He believes "silence is the only cure for the machine."
*   **Mechanic:** Summons roots that bind the player.

### End Boss: The Rotting Stag
*   **Lore:** The spirit of the forest. Its antlers are tuning forks that are bent and rusted, producing a dissonant screech.
*   **Mechanic:** Charge attacks. You must trick it into hitting the "Iron Trees" to stun it.
*   **Reward:** *Map to World 4*.

### Secret Boss: The Fungal Hive-Mind (Cthulhu Mythos)
*   **Gimmick Trigger:** You must be infected by "Spores" in Area 2 and *not* cure it until the end of Area 4.
*   **Lore:** A colony of sentient fungus from another dimension. It connects all living things into a single, screaming consciousness.
*   **Reward:** *Fragment of the First Song (3/5)*.
