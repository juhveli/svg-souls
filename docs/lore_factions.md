# Factions of the Chronocrystal Empire

## I. The Glazewrights (The Architects of Vanity)
*   **Philosophy:** "Visibility is Truth." They believe that if something cannot be seen or reflected, it does not exist. They sought to turn the entire world into a single, perfect prism.
*   **Role:** Scholars, Mages, and Nobility. They lived in the Glass Gardens (Area 2).
*   **Current State:** Driven mad by the Shatter. Now called "The Fractured," they obsessively polish the ruins of their world, attacking anything "dull" or "soft" (like the Player) as an impurity.
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **Archivist Pellinore:** Tried to write history into glass; now burns it.
    *   **Narcissus:** The Glass-Blower Deity who melted his own face.

## II. The Silent Choir (The Cult of Entropy)
*   **Philosophy:** "The Song was a Mistake." They believe the Grand Carillon's ringing caused the Shatter. Therefore, silence is the only cure. They view sound as pain and existence as a cacophony.
*   **Role:** Religious Zealots and Executioners. Headquartered in The Silent Spire (Area 4).
*   **Sub-Faction: The Silence Guard:**
    *   The militant arm of the Choir.
    *   **Uniform:** Heavy iron armor (to dampen sound) and mouths sewn shut with gold wire.
    *   **Weapon:** The **Tuning Fork Spear**. Used to skewer "noisy" living things and ground their vibration into the earth.
*   **Current State:** They patrol the lower levels, executing anything that makes noise. They are the primary antagonists in terms of organized resistance.

## III. The Gear-Keepers (The Blind Machine)
*   **Philosophy:** "The Loop Must Continue." They have no religion, only code. They do not know the world has ended; they only know the maintenance schedule is overdue.
*   **Role:** Laborers and Soldiers. Located in The Clockwork Arteries (Area 3).
*   **Composition:** Entirely automated constructs of brass and crystal. They are not "alive" in the traditional sense.
*   **Current State:** They are overheating. Without the cooling from the Glass Gardens (which are now shattered), they work themselves into a frenzy, attacking anything that disrupts their rhythm.
