# Lore Factions: The Societies of the Shatter

## I. The Glazewrights (World 2: Glass Gardens)
*The Architects of Vanity*

### History
Before the Shatter, the Glazewrights were the ruling class of the Chronocrystal Empire. They were alchemists and artists who believed that "opacity is a sin." They argued that skin hid the soul's light, and thus, true purity could only be achieved by replacing biological flesh with living crystal.
They succeeded. For centuries, the nobility lived as beautiful, transparent beings, drinking "Liquid Time" to keep their facets sharp.

### Philosophy
**"To be seen is to be."**
They worship Light and Reflection. They believe that if an object is not reflecting light, it does not truly exist. This has led to their current madness: they are terrified of the dark, for they believe they literally cease to exist when the lights go out.

### Visual Design
*   **Attire:** They do not wear cloth (which is opaque). They drape themselves in chains of prisms and stained-glass sashes that refract light.
*   **Physiology:** Their bodies are jagged, broken glass held together by a faint cyan magnetism. Many are missing limbs or faces, replaced by crude shards.
*   **Weapons:** Razor-sharp glass daggers, mirrors that reflect laser beams.

### Hierarchy
*   **The Matriarch (Vitria):** The supreme gardener who grows the "replacement parts" (crystal flora).
*   **The Blowers:** Priests who shape the molten glass into new citizens (now failed monsters).
*   **The Shards:** The common citizens, broken and mindless, attacking anything "opaque" (like the player) out of jealousy.

## II. The Gear-Keepers (World 3: Clockwork Arteries)
*The Antibodies of the Machine*

### History
The Gear-Keepers were originally a labor union of automatons created to maintain the Grand Carillon. Over millennia, the "Schedule" became their religion. They forgot they were maintaining a machine for *people* to live on; they began to view the people as "foreign objects" clogging the gears.
When the Shatter happened, they locked the doors to the Arteries, not to protect themselves, but to protect the Engine from the chaos outside.

### Philosophy
**"The Rhythm is Law."**
They do not believe in Good or Evil; they believe in "On-Time" and "Late."
To a Gear-Keeper, killing an intruder isn't murder; it's "removing an obstruction to the timeline." They apologize while killing you, not out of pity, but because the act of killing you is delaying their maintenance schedule.

### Visual Design
*   **Attire:** Heavy leather aprons (to resist heat) and brass welding masks.
*   **Physiology:** A mix of biological decay and brass prosthetics. Many have replaced their heads with metronomes or pressure gauges.
*   **Weapons:** Massive wrenches, steam-cannons, pistons.

### Hierarchy
*   **The General (Metronome):** The timekeeper. He sets the global BPM.
*   **The Marshals:** Overseers who enforce the rhythm in specific sectors.
*   **The Cogs:** Mindless drones who perform repetitive tasks (hammering, turning valves) forever.

## III. The Silent Choir (World 4: The Hushed Halls)
*The Martyrs of the Void*

### History
The Silent Choir was once the "Backup Singers" for the Grand Carillon. They resided in the library, recording the sheet music of history.
They were the first to discover the Prime Conductor's betrayal. They read the "Final Note" in the archives and realized it would erase free will. To prevent themselves from singing it, they took a vow of absolute silence.

### Philosophy
**"The Song is a Lie. The Silence is Truth."**
They worship the **Rest** (the silence between notes). They believe that sound is a corruption of the Void, and that true peace only exists in absolute zero-decibel environments.
They view the Conductor as a tyrant who enslaves reality through rhythm. By silencing the world, they believe they are freeing it. They are tragic figures, acting as "Sound-Eaters" to prevent the Apocalypse.

### Rituals: The Vow of the Gag
*   **The Stitching:** Upon initiation, a monk's lips are sewn shut with gold thread. This is not a punishment, but a "sealing of the vessel" to prevent the Conductor's song from entering or escaping.
*   **The Drowning:** They submerge themselves in tanks of heavy, viscous fluid that blocks all sound, meditating for weeks in sensory deprivation to "hear the Void."
*   **The Burning of Words:** Every year, they burn thousands of books from the library, believing that written words are "frozen noise" that must be released into ash.

### Architecture
Their domain is built to kill sound.
*   **Void-Stone:** The walls are made of a porous, black stone that absorbs 99% of acoustic energy.
*   **Velvet Drapes:** Every surface is covered in thick, heavy purple velvet.
*   **Dead Zones:** Certain chambers are magically enchanted so that sound waves literally cannot propagate; magic requiring verbal components fails here.

### Visual Design
*   **Attire:** Thick, heavy velvet robes in deep purple and black. These fabrics are designed to absorb sound. They wear soft slippers to walk silently.
*   **Physiology:** Pale, gaunt humanoids. Their most striking feature is their mouths, which are stitched shut. They have no eyes (as they do not need to read anymore), only massive, sensitive ears.
*   **Weapons:** Sonic-dampening bells, tuning forks that cancel out magic, "Hush" spells that silence the player.

### Hierarchy
*   **The Voice (Cantor):** The only one allowed to make sound, but he uses it as a weapon. He screams the "Anti-Verse" to shatter the Conductor's melodies.
*   **The Librarians:** Guardians of the forbidden sheet music. They "Shush" intruders (magic silence).
*   **The Monks:** The foot soldiers who swarm silently, strangling targets with velvet ropes to avoid the noise of a blade striking bone.
