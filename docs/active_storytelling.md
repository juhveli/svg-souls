# Active Storytelling Rules
**Goal:** Deliver narrative *during* combat and exploration without stealing camera control or using text-dumps.

## I. The Combat "Bark" System
Enemies are tragic figures trapped in loops. They shouldn't just grunt; they should reveal their "Glitch."

### 1. The Rule of 3
Every enemy type needs 3 distinct audio/text-bubble triggers:
1.  **Spotting the Player (The Trigger):** Reveals their specific delusion.
    *   *Bad:* "Intruder!"
    *   *Good:* "The inspection! I'm not ready! I'm not polished!"
2.  **Taking Damage (The Reality):** A moment of clarity or pain.
    *   *Good:* "I crack! I crack!" or "The song... it stopped?"
3.  **Death (The Release):** Final silence.
    *   *Good:* "Quiet... at last."

### 2. Boss "Mid-Fight" Storytelling
Bosses must talk *while* attacking to telegraph moves.
*   **Example (Archivist Pellinore):**
    *   *Attack Start:* "History is written by the... BURNING LIGHT!" (Shoots laser).
    *   *Phase Change:* "No! That page is torn! I must rewrite it!" (Transition animation).

## II. Diegetic UI & HUD
The UI is part of the "Soft One's" suit/perception.

1.  **The Resonance Meter (Mana):**
    *   **Visual:** A tuning fork overlay on the screen.
    *   **Behavior:** It vibrates (blurs) more intensely as mana fills.
    *   **Audio:** When full, the game audio gains a "Reverb" effect, signaling you are "in tune" and ready to cast.

2.  **Health (Integrity):**
    *   **Visual:** The edges of the screen do not turn red; they *desaturate* (turn black and white).
    *   **Meaning:** Losing health = Losing connection to the world's frequency. You allow the "Silence" to creep in.

## III. Environmental "Ghosts"
Use the "Glass" theme to show the past without cutscenes.

*   **The Reflection Mechanic:**
    *   Certain mirrors or polished surfaces show the room *as it was 1000 years ago* (The Golden Age).
    *   **Entertainment Value:** The player might see a beautiful ballroom dance in the reflection, but in reality, they are fighting the jagged, broken remains of those dancers in the same room.

## IV. Dynamic Music (The "Conductor" System)
The music tells you the state of the world.

*   **Layering:**
    *   **Layer 1 (Rhythm):** Always plays (Basic percussion).
    *   **Layer 2 (Melody):** Fades in only when the Player moves (The Soft One generates music).
    *   **Layer 3 (Dissonance):** Screeching violins fade in when low health or near a Boss.
