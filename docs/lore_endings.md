# Multiple Endings of Chronocrystal

The fate of the universe depends on the Echo Walker's choices and their connection to the First Song.

## Ending A: The Shatter (Bad Ending)
*   **Trigger:** Kill the Grand Architect in World 5.
*   **Lore:** You destroy the only thing holding the song together.
*   **Outcome:** The universe shatters into silence. The screen fades to white. Text: "THE SONG ENDS."
*   **Narrative:** You became the monster they feared.

## Ending B: The Resonance (Standard Good Ending)
*   **Trigger:** Spare the Grand Architect (Use *Crystallized Tear* to parry him).
*   **Lore:** You show him that Dissonance is not evil; it is part of the harmony.
*   **Outcome:** The Architect retunes the universe. The Echo Walker becomes the new "Metronome," keeping the beat forever.
*   **Narrative:** A bittersweet sacrifice. The world lives, but you are trapped in the machine.

## Ending C: The Silence (Vespers Ending)
*   **Trigger:** Save the Architect, but fail to defeat Vespers (The Void Mother) in the second phase.
*   **Lore:** Vespers consumes both you and the Architect.
*   **Outcome:** The Void wins. The screen goes black. Text: "PEACE AT LAST."
*   **Narrative:** Total entropy.

## Ending D: The Awakening (Secret / Eldritch Ending)
*   **Trigger:** Collect all 5 *Fragments of the First Song* and defeat **Azathoth, The Blind Singer**.
*   **Lore:** You realize the entire universe was just a dream of the Blind Singer. By defeating it, you wake it up.
*   **Outcome:** The game world "glitches" out. The characters realize they are fiction. The Echo Walker transcends the game.
*   **Cinematic:** The Echo Walker steps out of the screen frame.
*   **Message:** "THE DREAMER WAKES. THE DREAM ENDS. BUT THE DREAMER REMEMBERS."
