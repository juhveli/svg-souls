# Lore Locations: The Five Movements

## World 1: The Scrapyard (The Discarded)
*Theme: Rust, Brown/Orange, Discarded Prototypes*
The lowest point of the world, a massive landfill where "bad ideas" and "broken timelines" were thrown by the Architects. The air tastes of oxidized copper, and the only light comes from the faint bioluminescent glow of leaking "Liquid Time."

### Areas
1.  **The Rust Dunes:** Hills of oxidized iron dust.
    *   *Enemy Types:* Scavenger Crabs (Tanky, wandering), Rust-Mites (Small, swarming).
2.  **The Mannequin Graves:** Piles of discarded glass bodies that didn't make the cut.
    *   *Lore Hook:* "The First Draft of Humanity." It is here you find the **Mannequin's Glass Eye**, weeping in the dark.
3.  **The Smog Vent:** A narrow canyon where toxic gas (liquid time waste) flows.
    *   *Sub-Boss:* **The Trash-Compactor**. A massive, treaded machine that patrols this canyon, flattening anything that isn't already flat. It blocks the path to the pit.
4.  **Golgotha's Pit (Boss Arena):** A depression formed by the weight of the accumulation.

### Lore Fragments & Echoes
*   **Journal of a Disposal Officer:**
    > "We threw the first prototype down here today. It looked at me. It knew. I had to wash my hands for an hour, but I can still feel the grease."
*   **Echo (Scavenger Crab):**
    > "Don't look up... The sky is just the floor of the place that hated us."

## World 2: Glass Gardens (The Surface)
*Theme: Cyan/Teal, Fragile, Sharp Flora*
The residential district of the nobility. A city of high spires, greenhouses, and ballrooms, all constructed of prisms and spun sugar-glass. It is blindingly bright, refracting light into lethal lasers and beautiful rainbows.

### Areas
1.  **The Prism Path**
    The main thoroughfare of the city, suspended by "Hard Light Bridges" that only materialize when viewed through specific lenses. The path is lined with statues of the Glazewrights, their faces now cracked or vandalized by the overgrowth.

2.  **The Shattered Greenhouse**
    *Lore: "The Fertilizer".*
    Once a sanctuary for the world's flora, this dome has shattered. The plants here are fed not by water, but by "Ground-Up Time"—a glowing, golden dust made by crushing the seconds of the lower classes. The flora has mutated, becoming razor-sharp and aggressive, hungering for the time remaining in the player's blood.
    *   *Sub-Boss:* **The Glass-Blower Deity**. He floats above the wilted canopy, exhaling bubbles of molten glass that trap the player.

3.  **The Reflection Pools**
    Lakes of liquid mercury that do not show the present. Instead, they reflect the "Golden Age"—a time before the Shatter. In the reflection, the ruins are pristine ballrooms filled with dancing nobles; in reality, the player walks among corpses. Beware the *Vanity Wraiths* that hide in the mirror image.

4.  **The Conservatory (Boss Arena)**
    A giant, central glass dome that once served as the city's opera house. Now, the audience consists of petrified glass figures, frozen in eternal applause. At the center, **Vitria** tends to her deadly garden, believing her razor-vines are the only children who will never leave her.

### Lore Fragments & Echoes
*   **Lady A's Diary (Part 12):**
    > "My reflection blinked today. I must order a new mirror. This one is defective. It shows a face that looks... old."
*   **Echo (Glazewright Ghost):**
    > "Pretend you don't see the cracks, darling. Use more powder. If they see you bleed, they'll know you're real."

## World 3: The Clockwork Arteries (The Mechanism)
*Theme: Bronze/Gold, Steam, Rhythm*
The industrial underbelly that powers the Grand Carillon. Here, the heat is oppressive, and the sound is deafening. Every platform, piston, and vent moves to a strict 4/4 industrial techno beat.

### Areas
1.  **The Piston Chamber**
    A vertical shaft where massive brass pistons drive the world's heartbeat. Platforms rise and fall on the beat. Missing a jump isn't just a fall; it's a disruption of the rhythm that alerts the Gear-Keepers.

2.  **The Steam Vents**
    Corridors filled with pipes circulating "Liquid Time" at boiling temperatures. Vents erupt on the off-beat, creating a hazard for those who cannot keep time. The steam distorts vision, creating mirages of gears that aren't there.
    *   *Sub-Boss:* **The Steam-Marshal**. A hulking construct of brass and pressure valves. He blocks the main valve, drowning the room in steam if challenged.

3.  **The Gear-Train**
    A high-speed traversal section where the player must ride atop massive, rotating cogs. These gears turn fast enough to blur, carrying the player deep into the machine's core. "The only safe place is the teeth."

4.  **The Engine Room (Boss Arena)**
    The central drive shaft of the Carillon. The room itself is a weapon, rotating and shifting phases. **The Metronome General** stands here, beating the world into submission with his mace, ensuring the "Heartbeat" never skips, even if he has to stop it to fix it.

### Lore Fragments & Echoes
*   **Production Shift Log 9901:**
    > "Productivity down 0.02%. The General is displeased. He suggests we remove the sleep cycle. If we do not sleep, we cannot dream of stopping."
*   **Echo (Piston Drone):**
    > "Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. If you stop... you die... Tick..."

## World 4: The Hushed Halls (The Library)
*Theme: Velvet Purple/Black, Silence, Libraries*
A sanctuary built to absorb sound. Every surface is covered in heavy curtains, thick carpets, and black "Void-Stone" that absorbs light and noise. It is the only place in the world where the Carillon cannot be heard.

### Areas
1.  **The Muted Gallery**
    Long corridors lined with portraits of the world's history. The paint is "screaming"—mouths open in terror—but no sound comes out. The air is thick and heavy, dampening movement and suppressing magical resonance.

2.  **The Archive of Lost Seconds**
    A library not of books, but of jars. Each jar contains a "Lost Second"—a moment of time that was wasted by a citizen. The jars glow with a dim, regretful light. Smashing one releases a ghost of the person who wasted it.
    *   *Sub-Boss:* **The Librarian**. She patrols the aisles, shushing anyone who makes noise. If you are silenced, you cannot cast spells.

3.  **The Velvet Sanctum**
    *Lore: "The Gag of the Saint".*
    A religious site for the Silent Choir. The central altar holds the "Gag"—a cloth woven from the void itself, used to silence the First Prophet who tried to warn the world about the Conductor. The monks here have sewn their own mouths shut to honor the silence.

4.  **The Echo Chamber (Boss Arena)**
    A paradox: a room designed to amplify the slightest whisper into a sonic weapon. The walls are parabolic mirrors for sound. **Cantor** awaits here, his voice capable of shattering the player's crystal form with a single note.

### Lore Fragments & Echoes
*   **A Scrawled Note in Blood:**
    > "The Conductor isn't saving us. He's composing a requiem. Don't let him finish the..." (The note ends in a violent ink blot).
*   **Echo (Silent Monk):**
    > "Shhh... Do not scream. The walls are listening, and they are hungry for new sounds."

## World 5: The Crystal Belfry (The Source)
*Theme: White/Prismatic, Blinding Light, Abstract*
The summit of existence. The reality here is thin, dissolving into static and white noise. Geometry becomes non-Euclidean, with stairs leading nowhere and light behaving like a solid. The air smells of ozone and "new car smell"—the scent of a reality that hasn't been unwrapped yet.

### Areas
1.  **The Spiral Stair**
    Floating steps made of solidified light that spiral up into the void. There are no railings, and the "sky" is a wall of television static. Occasionally, the static clears to show *other worlds*, implying this reality is but one channel of many.
    *   *Visual Detail:* The steps chime like piano keys when stepped on.
    *   *Sub-Boss:* **The Gatekeeper**. A being of pure lens flare that guards the ascent. Looking directly at him blinds the player.

2.  **The Bell-Foundry**
    The celestial workshop where the Bells of Creation were cast. The molds are still hot, smelling of ozone and petrichor. Broken, rejected bells litter the floor—universes that rang false and were discarded before they began.
    *   *Lore Hook:* "The Bell of Regret." A massive, cracked bell that, when struck, plays a note that makes the player weep (camera shake + blur).

3.  **The Singularity Point**
    The very tip of the tower, where all timelines converge. Here, the player can see "Echoes" of other players (or themselves from previous runs) wandering in the distance. The laws of physics (gravity, time) flicker on and off.
    *   *Environment:* Objects from previous worlds (a gear, a glass flower) float here in zero gravity, stripped of their texture, appearing as "Wireframes of Reality"—the underlying math of the world exposed.

4.  **The Carillon Deck (Boss Arena)**
    The massive musical instrument that regulates the flow of time. The keyboard is the size of a building. **The Prime Conductor** waits at the organ, his back to the player, playing the song that keeps the world trapped in its loop.
    *   *The Secret Path:* If the player possesses the four "Keys to the Paradox" (Scale, Shard, Spring, Throat), a hidden door opens behind the organ leading to **The Zero Point** (The Paradox Boss Fight).

### Lore Fragments & Echoes
*   **Corrupted Log File:**
    > "Iteration #403 unstable. The subject is resisting the rewrite. The song cannot resolve. We must... eject..."
*   **Echo (The Static):**
    > "I can see the math... it's all just numbers... We are just... music..."
