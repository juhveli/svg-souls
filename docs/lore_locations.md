# Lore Locations: The Five Movements

## World 1: The Scrapyard (The Discarded)
*Theme: Rust, Brown/Orange, Discarded Prototypes*
The lowest point of the world, a massive landfill where "bad ideas" and "broken timelines" were thrown by the Architects. The air tastes of oxidized copper, and the only light comes from the faint bioluminescent glow of leaking "Liquid Time."

### Areas
1.  **The Rust Dunes:** Hills of oxidized iron dust.
    *   *Enemy Types:* Scavenger Crabs (Tanky, wandering), Rust-Mites (Small, swarming).
2.  **The Mannequin Graves:** Piles of discarded glass bodies that didn't make the cut.
    *   *Lore Hook:* "The First Draft of Humanity." It is here you find the **Mannequin's Glass Eye**, weeping in the dark.
3.  **The Smog Vent:** A narrow canyon where toxic gas (liquid time waste) flows.
4.  **Golgotha's Pit (Boss Arena):** A depression formed by the weight of the accumulation.

## World 2: Glass Gardens (The Surface)
*Theme: Cyan/Teal, Fragile, Sharp Flora*
The residential district of the nobility. A city of high spires, greenhouses, and ballrooms, all constructed of prisms and spun sugar-glass. It is blindingly bright, refracting light into lethal lasers and beautiful rainbows.

### Areas
1.  **The Prism Path**
    The main thoroughfare of the city, suspended by "Hard Light Bridges" that only materialize when viewed through specific lenses. The path is lined with statues of the Glazewrights, their faces now cracked or vandalized by the overgrowth.

2.  **The Shattered Greenhouse**
    *Lore: "The Fertilizer".*
    Once a sanctuary for the world's flora, this dome has shattered. The plants here are fed not by water, but by "Ground-Up Time"—a glowing, golden dust made by crushing the seconds of the lower classes. The flora has mutated, becoming razor-sharp and aggressive, hungering for the time remaining in the player's blood.

3.  **The Reflection Pools**
    Lakes of liquid mercury that do not show the present. Instead, they reflect the "Golden Age"—a time before the Shatter. In the reflection, the ruins are pristine ballrooms filled with dancing nobles; in reality, the player walks among corpses. Beware the *Vanity Wraiths* that hide in the mirror image.

4.  **The Conservatory (Boss Arena)**
    A giant, central glass dome that once served as the city's opera house. Now, the audience consists of petrified glass figures, frozen in eternal applause. At the center, **Vitria** tends to her deadly garden, believing her razor-vines are the only children who will never leave her.

## World 3: The Clockwork Arteries (The Mechanism)
*Theme: Bronze/Gold, Steam, Rhythm*
The industrial underbelly that powers the Grand Carillon. Here, the heat is oppressive, and the sound is deafening. Every platform, piston, and vent moves to a strict 4/4 industrial techno beat.

### Areas
1.  **The Piston Chamber**
    A vertical shaft where massive brass pistons drive the world's heartbeat. Platforms rise and fall on the beat. Missing a jump isn't just a fall; it's a disruption of the rhythm that alerts the Gear-Keepers.

2.  **The Steam Vents**
    Corridors filled with pipes circulating "Liquid Time" at boiling temperatures. Vents erupt on the off-beat, creating a hazard for those who cannot keep time. The steam distorts vision, creating mirages of gears that aren't there.

3.  **The Gear-Train**
    A high-speed traversal section where the player must ride atop massive, rotating cogs. These gears turn fast enough to blur, carrying the player deep into the machine's core. "The only safe place is the teeth."

4.  **The Engine Room (Boss Arena)**
    The central drive shaft of the Carillon. The room itself is a weapon, rotating and shifting phases. **The Metronome General** stands here, beating the world into submission with his mace, ensuring the "Heartbeat" never skips, even if he has to stop it to fix it.

## World 4: The Hushed Halls (The Library)
*Theme: Velvet Purple/Black, Silence, Libraries*
A sanctuary built to absorb sound. Every surface is covered in heavy curtains, thick carpets, and sound-proofing foam. It is the only place in the world where the Carillon cannot be heard.

### Areas
1.  **The Muted Gallery**
    Long corridors lined with portraits of the world's history. The paint is "screaming"—mouths open in terror—but no sound comes out. The air is thick and heavy, dampening movement and suppressing magical resonance.

2.  **The Archive of Lost Seconds**
    A library not of books, but of jars. Each jar contains a "Lost Second"—a moment of time that was wasted by a citizen. The jars glow with a dim, regretful light. Smashing one releases a ghost of the person who wasted it.

3.  **The Velvet Sanctum**
    *Lore: "The Gag of the Saint".*
    A religious site for the Silent Choir. The central altar holds the "Gag"—a cloth woven from the void itself, used to silence the First Prophet who tried to warn the world about the Conductor. The monks here have sewn their own mouths shut to honor the silence.

4.  **The Echo Chamber (Boss Arena)**
    A paradox: a room designed to amplify the slightest whisper into a sonic weapon. The walls are parabolic mirrors for sound. **Cantor** awaits here, his voice capable of shattering the player's crystal form with a single note.

---

## World 5: The Crystal Belfry (The Source)
*Theme: White/Prismatic, Blinding Light, Abstract*
The summit of existence. The reality here is thin, dissolving into static and white noise. Geometry becomes non-Euclidean, with stairs leading nowhere and light behaving like a solid. The air smells of ozone and "new car smell"—the scent of a reality that hasn't been unwrapped yet.

### Areas
1.  **The Spiral Stair**
    Floating steps made of solidified light that spiral up into the void. There are no railings, and the "sky" is a wall of television static. Occasionally, the static clears to show *our* world (modern day Earth), implying the game world is just a simulation or a dream.
    *   *Visual Detail:* The steps chime like piano keys when stepped on.

2.  **The Bell-Foundry**
    The celestial workshop where the Bells of Creation were cast. The molds are still hot, smelling of ozone and petrichor. Broken, rejected bells litter the floor—universes that rang false and were discarded before they began.
    *   *Lore Hook:* "The Bell of Regret." A massive, cracked bell that, when struck, plays a note that makes the player weep (camera shake + blur).

3.  **The Singularity Point**
    The very tip of the tower, where all timelines converge. Here, the player can see "Echoes" of other players (or themselves from previous runs) wandering in the distance. The laws of physics (gravity, time) flicker on and off like a bad connection.
    *   *Environment:* Objects from previous worlds (a gear, a glass flower) float here in zero gravity, stripped of their texture (whitebox models), revealing the underlying code of the world.

4.  **The Carillon Deck (Boss Arena)**
    The massive musical instrument that regulates the flow of time. The keyboard is the size of a building. **The Prime Conductor** waits at the organ, his back to the player, playing the song that keeps the world trapped in its loop.
    *   *The Secret Path:* If the player possesses the four "Keys to the Paradox" (Scale, Shard, Spring, Throat), a hidden door opens behind the organ leading to **The Developer's Room** (The Paradox Boss Fight).
