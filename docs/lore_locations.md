# Lore Locations: The Five Movements

## World 1: The Scrapyard (The Discarded)
*Theme: Rust, Brown/Orange, Discarded Prototypes*
The lowest point of the world, a massive landfill where "bad ideas" and "broken timelines" were thrown by the Architects. The air tastes of oxidized copper, and the only light comes from the faint bioluminescent glow of leaking "Liquid Time."

### Areas
1.  **The Rust Dunes**
    Rolling hills composed entirely of oxidized iron dust and gears ground down to sand. The wind here carries a metallic screech, like a rusty hinge. Scavenger Crabs roam the dunes, sifting through the debris for intact springs to consume.

2.  **The Mannequin Graves**
    *Lore: "The First Draft of Humanity".*
    A harrowing valley piled high with thousands of smooth, featureless glass dolls. These were the "Batch 404" prototypes—bodies created by the Glazewrights that lacked the capacity to hold resonance (a soul). They were discarded here, unbroken but empty, their hollow eyes staring up at the world that rejected them.

3.  **The Smog Vent**
    A narrow, toxic canyon where the byproduct of the world's machinery flows. This "Smog" is actually vaporized time-waste—seconds that were deemed too impure for the main timeline. Breathing it causes one to age rapidly, their skin rusting in real-time.

4.  **Golgotha's Pit (Boss Arena)**
    A massive depression in the center of the scrap heap, formed by the sheer weight of the accumulation. The walls are lined with compressed trash, and the floor is a shifting sea of jagged metal where **Golgotha** has made his nest, hoarding the "soft parts" of the mannequins in a desperate attempt to build himself a soul.

## World 2: Glass Gardens (The Surface)
*Theme: Cyan/Teal, Fragile, Sharp Flora*
The residential district of the nobility. A city of high spires, greenhouses, and ballrooms, all constructed of prisms and spun sugar-glass. It is blindingly bright, refracting light into lethal lasers and beautiful rainbows.

### Areas
1.  **The Prism Path**
    The main thoroughfare of the city, suspended by "Hard Light Bridges" that only materialize when viewed through specific lenses. The path is lined with statues of the Glazewrights, their faces now cracked or vandalized by the overgrowth.

2.  **The Shattered Greenhouse**
    *Lore: "The Fertilizer".*
    Once a sanctuary for the world's flora, this dome has shattered. The plants here are fed not by water, but by "Ground-Up Time"—a glowing, golden dust made by crushing the seconds of the lower classes. The flora has mutated, becoming razor-sharp and aggressive, hungering for the time remaining in the player's blood.

3.  **The Reflection Pools**
    Lakes of liquid mercury that do not show the present. Instead, they reflect the "Golden Age"—a time before the Shatter. In the reflection, the ruins are pristine ballrooms filled with dancing nobles; in reality, the player walks among corpses. Beware the *Vanity Wraiths* that hide in the mirror image.

4.  **The Conservatory (Boss Arena)**
    A giant, central glass dome that once served as the city's opera house. Now, the audience consists of petrified glass figures, frozen in eternal applause. At the center, **Vitria** tends to her deadly garden, believing her razor-vines are the only children who will never leave her.

## World 3: The Clockwork Arteries (The Mechanism)
*Theme: Bronze/Gold, Steam, Rhythm*
The industrial underbelly that powers the Grand Carillon. Here, the heat is oppressive, and the sound is deafening. Every platform, piston, and vent moves to a strict 4/4 industrial techno beat.

### Areas
1.  **The Piston Chamber**
    A vertical shaft where massive brass pistons drive the world's heartbeat. Platforms rise and fall on the beat. Missing a jump isn't just a fall; it's a disruption of the rhythm that alerts the Gear-Keepers.

2.  **The Steam Vents**
    Corridors filled with pipes circulating "Liquid Time" at boiling temperatures. Vents erupt on the off-beat, creating a hazard for those who cannot keep time. The steam distorts vision, creating mirages of gears that aren't there.

3.  **The Gear-Train**
    A high-speed traversal section where the player must ride atop massive, rotating cogs. These gears turn fast enough to blur, carrying the player deep into the machine's core. "The only safe place is the teeth."

4.  **The Engine Room (Boss Arena)**
    The central drive shaft of the Carillon. The room itself is a weapon, rotating and shifting phases. **The Metronome General** stands here, beating the world into submission with his mace, ensuring the "Heartbeat" never skips, even if he has to stop it to fix it.

## World 4: The Hushed Halls (The Library)
*Theme: Velvet Purple/Black, Silence, Libraries*
A sanctuary built to absorb sound. Every surface is covered in heavy curtains, thick carpets, and sound-proofing foam. It is the only place in the world where the Carillon cannot be heard.

### Areas
1.  **The Muted Gallery**
    Long corridors lined with portraits of the world's history. The paint is "screaming"—mouths open in terror—but no sound comes out. The air is thick and heavy, dampening movement and suppressing magical resonance.

2.  **The Archive of Lost Seconds**
    A library not of books, but of jars. Each jar contains a "Lost Second"—a moment of time that was wasted by a citizen. The jars glow with a dim, regretful light. Smashing one releases a ghost of the person who wasted it.

3.  **The Velvet Sanctum**
    *Lore: "The Gag of the Saint".*
    A religious site for the Silent Choir. The central altar holds the "Gag"—a cloth woven from the void itself, used to silence the First Prophet who tried to warn the world about the Conductor. The monks here have sewn their own mouths shut to honor the silence.

4.  **The Echo Chamber (Boss Arena)**
    A paradox: a room designed to amplify the slightest whisper into a sonic weapon. The walls are parabolic mirrors for sound. **Cantor** awaits here, his voice capable of shattering the player's crystal form with a single note.

---

## World 5: The Crystal Belfry (The Source)
*Theme: White/Prismatic, Blinding Light, Abstract*
The summit of existence. The reality here is thin, dissolving into static and white noise. Geometry becomes non-Euclidean, with stairs leading nowhere and light behaving like a solid.

### Areas
1.  **The Spiral Stair**
    Floating steps made of solidified light that spiral up into the void. There are no railings, and the "sky" is a wall of television static. Falling here means falling out of existence entirely.

2.  **The Bell-Foundry**
    The celestial workshop where the Bells of Creation were cast. The molds are still hot, smelling of ozone and petrichor. Broken, rejected bells litter the floor—universes that rang false and were discarded before they began.

3.  **The Singularity Point**
    The very tip of the tower, where all timelines converge. Here, the player can see "Echoes" of other players (or themselves from previous runs) wandering in the distance. The laws of physics (gravity, time) flicker on and off like a bad connection.

4.  **The Carillon Deck (Boss Arena)**
    The massive musical instrument that regulates the flow of time. The keyboard is the size of a building. **The Prime Conductor** waits at the organ, his back to the player, playing the song that keeps the world trapped in its loop.
