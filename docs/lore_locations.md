# Lore Locations: The Five Movements

## World 1: The Scrapyard
*Theme: Rust, Brown/Orange, Discarded Prototypes*
The lowest point of the world. A massive landfill where "bad ideas" and "broken timelines" were thrown by the Architects.

### Areas
1.  **The Rust Dunes:** Hills of oxidized iron dust.
    *   *Enemy Types:* Scavenger Crabs (Tanky, wandering), Rust-Mites (Small, swarming).
2.  **The Mannequin Graves:** Piles of discarded glass bodies that didn't make the cut.
    *   *Lore Hook:* "The First Draft of Humanity." It is here you find the **Mannequin's Glass Eye**, weeping in the dark.
3.  **The Smog Vent:** A narrow canyon where toxic gas (liquid time waste) flows.
4.  **Golgotha's Pit (Boss Arena):** A depression formed by the weight of the accumulation.

## World 2: Glass Gardens
*Theme: Cyan/Teal, Fragile, Sharp Flora*
The residential district. Beautiful but deadly. The trees are spun sugar-glass; the grass is razor wire.

### Areas
1.  **The Prism Path:** The main road, refracting light into blinding rainbows.
2.  **The Shattered Greenhouse:** Where the flora has overgrown the containment.
    *   *TODO: Lore about the "Fertilizer" being ground-up time.*
3.  **The Reflection Pools:** Mercury lakes that show incorrect reflections (timelines that didn't happen).
4.  **The Conservatory (Boss Arena):** A giant glass dome.

## World 3: The Clockwork Arteries
*Theme: Bronze/Gold, Steam, Rhythm*
The industrial zone. Massive gears, pistons, and pipes. The heartbeat of the world.

### Areas
1.  **The Piston Chamber:** Platforms that move to a 4/4 beat.
2.  **The Steam Vents:** Hazards that erupt on the off-beat.
3.  **The Gear-Train:** A high-speed traversal section on moving cogs.
4.  **The Engine Room (Boss Arena):** The central drive shaft of the Carillon.

## World 4: The Hushed Halls
*Theme: Velvet Purple/Black, Silence, Libraries*
A sanctuary built to absorb sound. Everything is covered in heavy curtains and thick carpets.

### Areas
1.  **The Muted Gallery:** Corridors of paintings that scream silently.
2.  **The Archive of Lost Seconds:** Where "wasted time" is stored in jars.
3.  **The Velvet Sanctum:** A religious site for the Silent Choir.
    *   *TODO: Lore item "The Gag of the Saint".*
4.  **The Echo Chamber (Boss Arena):** A paradox—a room designed to amplify the slightest whisper into a weapon.

## World 5: The Crystal Belfry
*Theme: White/Prismatic, Blinding Light, Abstract*
The summit. The reality here is thin. Geometry is non-Euclidean.

### Areas
1.  **The Spiral Stair:** Floating steps made of light.
2.  **The Bell-Foundry:** Where the Bells of Creation were cast.
3.  **The Singularity Point:** The very tip of the tower.
