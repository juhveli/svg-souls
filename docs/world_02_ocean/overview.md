# World 2: The Echoing Ocean
**Theme:** Liquid Time, Sonar, Pressure, Bioluminescence.
**Core Concept:** Time flows thicker here. It is a "Sea of Condensed Moments." Sound travels further but is distorted.

## Areas

### Area 1: The Tide Pools
*   **Visuals:** Shallow, crystalline water. The "sand" is ground glass.
*   **Mechanics:** "Wading" slows movement. Ripples alert enemies.
*   **Lore:** This is where moments wash up before they dissolve.

### Area 2: The Coral Cathedrals
*   **Visuals:** Massive reefs made of calcified trumpets and organ pipes.
*   **Mechanics:** Currents (Push zones). You must hide in the "Coral" to avoid "Sonar Sweeps" from predators.
*   **Lore:** The creatures here build shells out of music.

### Area 3: The Abyssal Trench
*   **Visuals:** Pitch black. Only bioluminescence guides you.
*   **Mechanics:** **Pressure**. Your "Resonance" drains slowly over time unless you find air pockets (Silence Bubbles).
*   **Lore:** The pressure of time here is so great it crushes steel.

### Area 4: The Sunken Bell
*   **Visuals:** An inverted tower, hanging into the void.
*   **Boss Arena:** The tip of the bell, surrounded by the infinite drop.

## Bosses

### Sub-Boss: The Siren of Shards
*   **Lore:** A construct that mimics the voice of the Grand Architect to lure travelers.
*   **Mechanic:** Inverts your controls when she sings.

### End Boss: The Kraken of Glass
*   **Lore:** A guardian beast. Its ink is "Void Liquid" that erases existence.
*   **Mechanic:** You must break its tentacles to stop it from strangling the Bell.
*   **Reward:** *Map to World 3*.

### Secret Boss: The Drowned Leviathan (Cthulhu Mythos)
*   **Gimmick Trigger:** You must carry a "Heavy Anchor" item from Area 1 all the way to the Trench without dropping it (no dashing).
*   **Lore:** An ancient god that sleeps in the deep. It dreams the world into existence. Waking it is a mistake.
*   **Reward:** *Fragment of the First Song (2/5)*.
