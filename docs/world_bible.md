# World Bible: The Chronocrystal Empire
*Draft 2.0 - The Five Movements*

## I. Core Concept
A world where **Time is Sound**, and **Matter is Crystal**.
The flow of time is regulated by a massive, crystalline mechanism—**The Grand Carillon**. When it chimes, time moves. The world is beautiful, transparent, and impossibly sharp.

## II. The Cosmology: The Five Movements (Worlds)
The world is constructed in five concentric layers, representing the path from the waste of creation to the divine source.

1.  **The Scrapyard (The Discarded):** Where failed realities and broken timelines are dumped.
2.  **Glass Gardens (The Surface):** The fragile, beautiful world where the citizens lived.
3.  **The Clockwork Arteries (The Mechanism):** The industrial underbelly powering the Carillon.
4.  **The Hushed Halls (The Library):** A sound-dampened sanctuary where the "Sheet Music of Reality" was written.
5.  **The Crystal Belfry (The Source):** The apex where the Carillon and the Prismatic Core reside.

## III. The True History (The Deception)

### 1. The Myth (What You Are Told)
*   **The Problem:** The world has "Shattered" because the **Dissonance Kings** (Zone Bosses) rebelled against the harmony. They are hoarding the resonance, freezing time in their domains.
*   **The Mission:** You, the **Echo Walker**, are awakened by **The Prime Conductor**. He tasks you with hunting down the Kings, collecting their resonance, and bringing it to the Belfry to "Restart the Song" and save existence.

### 2. The Truth (What Is Hidden)
*   **The Reality:** The Dissonance Kings are actually **Wardens**. The "Shatter" wasn't a mistake; it was a desperate containment measure.
*   **The Wardens' Goal:** They *stopped* the song to prevent the Conductor from playing the "Final Note"—a frequency so high it would unite all consciousness into a single, static singularity (Himself).
*   **The Protagonist:** You are not a savior. You are a **battering ram**. Your unique "dampening" physiology allows you to kill the Wardens who are immune to the Conductor's influence.
*   **The Twist:** By killing the bosses, you are unlocking the chains holding the Conductor back.

## IV. The Factions

### 1. The Glazewrights (Scholars) - World 2
*   Created the glass bodies of the citizens. Now mad, trying to "fix" the broken glass of the world.

### 2. The Gear-Keepers (Labor) - World 3
*   Automatons who maintain the rhythm. They view you as a "Foreign Object" in the gears.

### 3. The Silent Choir (Religious) - World 4
*   Fanatics who worship the silence between notes. They realized the Conductor's madness first and tried to hide the Sheet Music.

## V. Magic System: Resonance
*   **Mana:** "Vibration."
*   **Mechanic:** Strike to gain Resonance. Spend Resonance to cast Spells (Dissonant Arts).

## VI. The Antagonist Hierarchy
1.  **The Preliminary Antagonists:** The Zone Bosses (Golgotha, Vitria, The Metronome, etc.). Framed as villains.
2.  **The Hidden Antagonist:** **The Prime Conductor**. The quest giver who guides you via "Echoes" throughout the game.
3.  **The True Threat:** **The Static**. The void that enters when the song ends.
