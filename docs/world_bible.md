# World Bible: The Chronocrystal Empire
*Draft 1.0 - Hybrid Concept: Clockwork (Mechanics/Time) + Glass (Fragility/Beauty)*

## I. Core Concept
A world where **Time is Sound**, and **Matter is Crystal**.
The flow of time is regulated by a massive, crystalline mechanism—Introduction of the **Grand Carillon**. When it chimes, time moves. The world is beautiful, transparent, and impossibly sharp.

## II. The True History (The Iceberg)

### 1. The Golden Age: The Age of Resonance
*   **The Society:** The **Luminary Watchmakers** built cities of stained glass and clockwork. They believed that by tuning the world to the "Perfect Pitch," they could achieve immortality.
*   **The Tech:** They forged **Chronoglass**, a material that vibrates with the frequency of time.
    *   *Rich citizens:* Replaced their flesh with delicate, ticking glass limbs.
    *   *The Source:* **The Prismatic Core**, a giant crystal heart at the center of the world that "ticked" the rhythm of existence.

### 2. The Inciting Incident: The Dissonance (The Shatter)
*   **The Event:** To stop the eventual end of the universe, the Grand Architect tried to "pause" the Grand Carillon forever—to create an eternal moment of perfection.
*   **The Result:** The tension was too great. The Core didn't stop; it **shattered**.
*   **The Effect:**
    *   **Time Fragmentation:** Time didn't stop. It broke into shards. Some rooms are stuck in a 3-second loop. Others are frozen. Others age rapidly.
    *   **The Glass Plague:** The silence drove the crystalline citizens insane. Their beautiful glass bodies jagged and warped. They are now **The Fractured**—obsessed with "fixing" the rhythm by smashing anything that moves out of beat.

### 3. The Current State: The Shardscape
*   **The Setting:** A ruin of ticking gears and broken glass. It is hauntingly beautiful—sunlight refracting through floating debris, rainbows cutting through the gloom.
*   **The Protagonist:** You are the **Soft One** (or **The Damper**). A being of cloth, leather, and blood—materials that *absorb* sound and vibration rather than reflecting it. You are the only thing that doesn't "ring" when hit.

## III. Key Factions & Bosses

### 1. The Glazewrights (Scholars)
*   **Lore:** They tried to write history into glass tablets.
*   **Boss:** **Archivist Pellinore**, a being made of magnifying lenses and scrolls. He burns you with focused light while frantically rewriting a history that changes every time the clock ticks.

### 2. The Gear-Keepers (Military)
*   **Lore:** Automatons tasked with keeping the Carillon running. Now they "repair" things that aren't broken.
*   **Boss:** **The Metronome General**. A four-armed glass centaur. He attacks strictly on the beat of the background music. If you dodge *off-beat*, you take extra damage (or he counters).

### 3. The Silent Choir (Religious)
*   **Lore:** Fanatics who believe the shattering was a holy release. They worship the silence between ticks.
*   **Enemy Type:** **Hush-Maidens**. They have no faces, only smooth glass bowls. They scream silence, creating zones where your spells/audio cues don't work.

## IV. The Magic System: Resonance
*   **Mana:** "Vibration." You gain it by striking enemies (ringing them) or parrying perfectly (tuning them).
*   **Spells:**
    *   *Shatter-Song:* High frequency scream that breaks shields.
    *   *Stasis-Hum:* Low frequency hum that slows local time.
    *   *Refract:* Turn into light briefly to dash through attacks.

## V. The Hook (Player Motivation)
*   **Goal:** "The World is ringing itself apart. You must ascend the Crystal Belfry and dampen the Core."
*   **The Twist:** The "Soft One" (You) is actually the *waste product* of the perfection process—the discarded mortality of the Architect. You are the only thing real enough to touch the Core without shattering it.

**Status:** Pending Integration
**Action:** Add the following specification to the official Game World Lore documentation (currently local/unpushed).

# Entity Specification: The Echo Walker (Protagonist)

## Physical Characteristics

The Protagonist is a being of dissonant biology, existing between the resonance of the Glass Gardens and the silence of the Void.

### The Upper Form
The upper body appears humanoid but is draped in a heavy, tattered cloak woven from shadows and silence. The face is a void, a dark abyss where only two glowing cyan eyes pierce through, pulsing with the rhythm of the world's resonance.

### The Lower Form: The Writhing Mass
Beneath the cloak, the Echo Walker possesses no human legs. Instead, their form terminates in a **writhing mass of cephalopod-like tentacles**.
*   **Description**: These appendages are a dark, slick green-black, constantly shifting and whipping around, propelling the Walker with an unnatural, gliding grace.
*   **Origin**: This mutation is believed to be a symptom of prolonged exposure to the **Deep Resonance**, a frequency so low it unravels biological order, restructuring it into more "fluid" forms capable of navigating the chaotic soundscapes of the Shattered World.
*   **Mythos Connection**: Scholars of the Old World might compare this physiology to the eldritch horrors of ancient texts (Cthulhu Mythos), suggesting the Walker is not merely a survivor, but a hybrid entity—part resonating crystal, part void-born monstrosity.

### The Weapon: The Tuning Greatsword
A massive, two-pronged blade resembling a tuning fork. It does not merely cut; it *vibrates* matter apart. The Walker wields it with a telekinetic bond, the weapon often floating or thrusting independently of their body's orientation, guided by their will (and the player's cursor).
