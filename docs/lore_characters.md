# Entity Specification: The Echo Walker (Protagonist)

## Physical Characteristics

The Protagonist is a being of dissonant biology, existing between the resonance of the Glass Gardens and the silence of the Void.

### The Upper Form
The upper body appears humanoid but is draped in a heavy, tattered cloak woven from shadows and silence. The face is a void, a dark abyss where only two glowing cyan eyes pierce through, pulsing with the rhythm of the world's resonance.

### The Lower Form: The Writhing Mass
Beneath the cloak, the Echo Walker possesses no human legs. Instead, their form terminates in a **writhing mass of cephalopod-like tentacles**.
*   **Description**: These appendages are a dark, slick green-black, constantly shifting and whipping around, propelling the Walker with an unnatural, gliding grace.
*   **Origin**: This mutation is believed to be a symptom of prolonged exposure to the **Deep Resonance**, a frequency so low it unravels biological order, restructuring it into more "fluid" forms capable of navigating the chaotic soundscapes of the Shattered World.
*   **Mythos Connection**: Scholars of the Old World might compare this physiology to the eldritch horrors of ancient texts (Cthulhu Mythos), suggesting the Walker is not merely a survivor, but a hybrid entity—part resonating crystal, part void-born monstrosity.

### The Weapon: The Tuning Fork Spear
A massive, two-pronged spear resembling a tuning fork. It does not merely pierce; it *vibrates* matter apart. The Walker wields it with a telekinetic bond, the weapon often floating or thrusting independently of their body's orientation, guided by their will (and the player's cursor).
