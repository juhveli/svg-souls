# Entity Specification: The Echo Walker (Protagonist)

## Physical Characteristics

The Protagonist is a being of dissonant biology, existing between the resonance of the Glass Gardens and the silence of the Void.

### The Upper Form
The upper body appears humanoid but is draped in a heavy, tattered cloak woven from shadows and silence. The face is a void, a dark abyss where only two glowing cyan eyes pierce through, pulsing with the rhythm of the world's resonance.

### The Lower Form: The Writhing Mass
Beneath the cloak, the Echo Walker possesses no human legs. Instead, their form terminates in a **writhing mass of cephalopod-like tentacles**.
*   **Description**: These appendages are a dark, slick green-black, constantly shifting and whipping around, propelling the Walker with an unnatural, gliding grace.
*   **Origin**: This mutation is believed to be a symptom of prolonged exposure to the **Deep Resonance**, a frequency so low it unravels biological order, restructuring it into more "fluid" forms capable of navigating the chaotic soundscapes of the Shattered World.
*   **Mythos Connection**: Scholars of the Old World might compare this physiology to the eldritch horrors of ancient texts (Cthulhu Mythos), suggesting the Walker is not merely a survivor, but a hybrid entity—part resonating crystal, part void-born monstrosity.

### The Weapon: The Tuning Fork Spear
A massive, two-pronged spear resembling a tuning fork. It does not merely pierce; it *vibrates* matter apart. The Walker wields it with a telekinetic bond, the weapon often floating or thrusting independently of their body's orientation, guided by their will (and the player's cursor).

# The Antagonists

## The Grand Architect (The False Villain)
*   **Role:** The Ruler of Area 4 (The Silent Spire).
*   **Visuals:** An elderly figure composed of cracked, frosted glass. He sits at the organ console of the Grand Carillon. His hands are fused to the keys.
*   **Motivation:** He froze time to prevent the "Final Silence." He sees the Player (The Echo Walker) as an agent of chaos who will restart the clock and doom the world to eventual death.
*   **Tragedy:** He is not evil; he is terrified. He weeps constantly, his tears crystallizing into the *Crystallized Tears* key items.

## Vespers, The Mother of Silence (The True Villain)
*   **Role:** The Leader of the Silent Choir / Avatar of the Void.
*   **Visuals:** A towering, faceless entity made of negative space (Vantablack) wrapped in gold wire. She does not "move"; she simply appears closer.
*   **Motivation:** She manipulated the Architect into breaking the Carillon. She feeds on the static between radio frequencies. She wants to erase all "Resonance" (Life) from the universe.
*   **Encounter:** Hidden until the final moments of the Architect's fight.

## High-Inquisitor Canto (The Lieutenant)
*   **Role:** The Mid-Boss guarding the entrance to Area 4.
*   **Visuals:** A bloated Silence Guard captain. His armor is covered in "purity seals" (which are actually just silencing runes). He wields a massive bell-clapper as a mace.
*   **Lore:** He believes he is saving souls by silencing them. "A quiet soul is a saved soul."
