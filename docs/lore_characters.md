# Entity Specification: The Echo Walker (Protagonist)

## Physical Characteristics

The Protagonist is a being of dissonant biology, existing between the resonance of the Glass Gardens and the silence of the Void.

### The Upper Form
The upper body appears humanoid but is draped in a heavy, tattered cloak woven from shadows and silence. The face is a void, a dark abyss where only two glowing cyan eyes pierce through, pulsing with the rhythm of the world's resonance.

### The Lower Form: The Writhing Mass
Beneath the cloak, the Echo Walker possesses no human legs. Instead, their form terminates in a **writhing mass of cephalopod-like tentacles**.
*   **Description**: These appendages are a dark, slick green-black, constantly shifting and whipping around, propelling the Walker with an unnatural, gliding grace.
*   **Origin**: This mutation is believed to be a symptom of prolonged exposure to the **Deep Resonance**, a frequency so low it unravels biological order, restructuring it into more "fluid" forms capable of navigating the chaotic soundscapes of the Shattered World.
*   **Mythos Connection**: Scholars of the Old World might compare this physiology to the eldritch horrors of ancient texts (Cthulhu Mythos), suggesting the Walker is not merely a survivor, but a hybrid entity—part resonating crystal, part void-born monstrosity.

### The Weapon: The Tuning Fork Spear
A massive, two-pronged spear resembling a tuning fork. It does not merely pierce; it *vibrates* matter apart. The Walker wields it with a telekinetic bond, the weapon often floating or thrusting independently of their body's orientation, guided by their will (and the player's cursor).

## Origin: The Hollow Vessel
Why did the Prime Conductor choose *you*? Not because of your strength, but because of your emptiness.

*   **The Problem of Resonance:** The Dissonance Kings are so powerful that any normal being who touches their "Resonance" (Souls) would be instantly overwhelmed, their own internal song rewritten by the King's melody.
*   **The Perfect Container:** The Echo Walker is "Tone-Deaf" in a spiritual sense. They have no internal song. They are a "Hollow Vessel" or a "Silence Walking."
*   **The Conductor's Design:** The Conductor needed a bucket to carry the volatile liquid of the Kings' souls back to the Belfry. You are that bucket. You can absorb the maddening frequencies of Golgotha, Vitria, and the others because there is nothing inside you to be corrupted. You are the silence that can hold the scream.
