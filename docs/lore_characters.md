# Entity Specification: The Echo Walker (Protagonist)

## Physical Characteristics

The Protagonist is a being of dissonant biology, existing between the resonance of the Glass Gardens and the silence of the Void.

### The Upper Form
The upper body appears humanoid but is draped in a heavy, tattered cloak woven from shadows and silence. The face is a void, a dark abyss where only two glowing cyan eyes pierce through, pulsing with the rhythm of the world's resonance.

### The Lower Form: The Writhing Mass
Beneath the cloak, the Echo Walker possesses no human legs. Instead, their form terminates in a **writhing mass of cephalopod-like tentacles**.
*   **Description**: These appendages are a dark, slick green-black, constantly shifting and whipping around, propelling the Walker with an unnatural, gliding grace.
*   **Origin**: This mutation is believed to be a symptom of prolonged exposure to the **Deep Resonance**, a frequency so low it unravels biological order, restructuring it into more "fluid" forms capable of navigating the chaotic soundscapes of the Shattered World.
*   **Mythos Connection**: Scholars of the Old World might compare this physiology to the eldritch horrors of ancient texts (Cthulhu Mythos), suggesting the Walker is not merely a survivor, but a hybrid entity—part resonating crystal, part void-born monstrosity.

### The Weapon: The Tuning Fork Spear
A massive, two-pronged spear resembling a tuning fork. It does not merely pierce; it *vibrates* matter apart. The Walker wields it with a telekinetic bond, the weapon often floating or thrusting independently of their body's orientation, guided by their will (and the player's cursor).

## Origin: The Hollow Vessel
Why did the Prime Conductor choose *you*? Not because of your strength, but because of your emptiness.

*   **The Problem of Resonance:** The Dissonance Kings are so powerful that any normal being who touches their "Resonance" (Souls) would be instantly overwhelmed, their own internal song rewritten by the King's melody.
*   **The Perfect Container:** The Echo Walker is "Tone-Deaf" in a spiritual sense. They have no internal song. They are a "Hollow Vessel" or a "Silence Walking."
*   **The Conductor's Design:** The Conductor needed a bucket to carry the volatile liquid of the Kings' souls back to the Belfry. You are that bucket. You can absorb the maddening frequencies of Golgotha, Vitria, and the others because there is nothing inside you to be corrupted. You are the silence that can hold the scream.

## The Prime Conductor: The Deceptive Guide
*The Narrator of the Collapse*

The Prime Conductor appears to the player as a disembodied voice and through "Echo Statues"—cracked marble busts that hum when approached. He claims to be the benevolent architect of the world, seeking to fix the "Shatter."

### The Echoes (Dialogue Progression)

#### World 1: The Scrapyard (The Paternal Teacher)
*   **Tone:** Gentle, educational, slightly patronizing.
*   **Echo 1 (Start):** "Awake, little dampener. The world is out of tune. Do you hear it? The scratching? That is the sound of history rusting."
*   **Echo 2 (Before Golgotha):** "Golgotha... a tragic mistake. He hoards the waste, terrified to let go. You must help him... release it."

#### World 2: Glass Gardens (The Critical Artist)
*   **Tone:** Disgusted by the "imperfection" of the world.
*   **Echo 1:** "Do not be fooled by the pretty lights. This garden is a cemetery. Vitria choked the life out of this place with her vanity."
*   **Echo 2 (Before Vitria):** "She thinks she is protecting them. Prune her, little one. Make it clean."

#### World 3: Clockwork Arteries (The Impatient Manager)
*   **Tone:** Urgent, annoyed by delay.
*   **Echo 1:** "Hurry. The heartbeat is erratic. The General has locked the mechanism. He does not understand that *I* am the timekeeper."
*   **Echo 2 (Before Metronome):** "Break the clock. We do not need gears to keep time. We need *will*."

#### World 4: Hushed Halls (The Menacing Censor)
*   **Tone:** Cold, threatening. He realizes you are learning the truth.
*   **Echo 1:** "Why do you linger in the library? There is nothing here but lies written by cowards."
*   **Echo 2 (Before Cantor):** "Silence him. His song is off-key. He speaks of 'Endings.' There are no endings, only Da Capo."

#### World 5: Crystal Belfry (The Tyrant Revealed)
*   **Tone:** Manic, god-complex.
*   **Echo 1:** "You have brought me the notes! Now, I shall write a symphony that never fades! A world of pure, static perfection!"

## The Dissonance Kings (Boss Deep Dive)

### World 3 Boss: The Metronome General
*   **Visuals:** A massive brass construct fused with the central drive shaft. His head is a metronome that ticks constantly.
*   **The Glitch:** He is obsessed with maintaining the "Standard Time" of the Empire, not realizing the Empire fell centuries ago. He believes the "Shatter" was just a momentary skip in the record.
*   **Combat Lore:** Every attack is synchronized to the background music's BPM. If the player attacks off-beat, they deal reduced damage (mechanic).

### World 4 Boss: Cantor, The Voice of Void
*   **Visuals:** A floating figure wrapped in shreds of the "Void Gag." His face is missing, replaced by a black hole that sucks in light.
*   **The Glitch:** He saw the "Sheet Music of Reality" and realized it was a loop. He went mad trying to scream a note loud enough to break the loop, but his voice destroys matter.
*   **Combat Lore:** He uses "Silence Zones" where the player cannot cast spells. His ultimate attack, "The Anti-Verse," requires the player to hide behind sound-dampened pillars.

### World 5 Boss: The Prime Conductor
*   **Visuals:** A being of pure white light and geometry. He plays the Grand Carillon like an organ.
*   **The Glitch:** He is terrified of death/silence. He wants to ring the "Final Note"—a frequency so high it freezes time forever, creating a "Perfect Moment" that never ends.
*   **Combat Lore:** He uses the stolen abilities of the previous 4 bosses against you. Phase 2 involves him merging with the Carillon, turning the entire arena into a bullet-hell music sheet.

## Friendly(ish) Faces: The Survivors

### Tick-Tock, the Broken Bard
*   **Location:** World 3 (The Clockwork Arteries) - Sitting on a giant cog near the start of the Gear-Train.
*   **Visuals:** A figure wrapped in rags, but with a visible glass knee that he taps rhythmically with a wrench. His face is hidden by a welder's mask, but human eyes peer out.
*   **Role:** Lore Dump / Rhythm Tutor.
*   **The Story:** He was once a musician in the Glass Gardens, but he was thrown into the pit for playing "Jazz" (improvisation, which the Conductor hates). He survived the fall but broke his legs. The Gear-Keepers didn't kill him because his tapping was perfectly on beat. He now lives in the machine, finding the "music in the noise."
*   **Dialogue Sample:**
    > "One, two. One, two. You're off beat, little soft one. Squishy. Quiet. Disgusting. They say the Carillon will ring again. But I like the quiet between the ticks. That's where the music lives... using the rests."
