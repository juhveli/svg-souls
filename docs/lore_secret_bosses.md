# The Secret Bosses: Fragments of the First Song

The universe of Chronocrystal is a song sung to keep the Void at bay. But there are **Dissonant Notes**—creatures from the Void that slipped in between the bars of the music. These are the Secret Bosses.

## The Fragments (Key Items)
Collecting these is dangerous. They increase the player's "Insight" (Eldritch Stat).
*   **Effect:** Higher Insight = You see things that aren't there. UI glitches. Hidden platforms appear.
*   **Goal:** Collect all 5 to unlock the True Final Encounter.

## 1. World 1: The Faceless Bell-Ringer
*   **Location:** World 1, Area 4 (Inside the Bell).
*   **Trigger:** Play "The Forbidden Chord" by ringing the area bells in reverse order (3-2-1).
*   **Entity:** A Shoggoth-like mass of eyes hiding in the bell's housing.
*   **Lore:** It tries to ring the bell to summon its masters.

## 2. World 2: The Drowned Leviathan
*   **Location:** World 2, Area 3 (The Trench).

## 3. World 3: The Fungal Hive-Mind
*   **Location:** World 3, Area 4 (Canopy).

*   **Entity:** A geometric horror of shifting angles.
*   **Lore:** A creature from the 4th dimension that eats 3D space.

## 5. World 5: The Shadow of the Architect
*   **Location:** World 5, Boss Room.

## THE FINAL SECRET BOSS: Azathoth, The Blind Singer
*   **Requirement:** Defeat the Grand Architect (or Save him) + Possess all 5 Fragments.
*   **The Reveal:** The walls of reality dissolve. The Architect screams, "IT HEARD US!"
*   **The Boss:** A bubbling mass of nuclear chaos at the center of the screen.
