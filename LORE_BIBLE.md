# LORE BIBLE: CHRONOCRYSTAL

## Core Metaphysics
*   **Resonance:** The life-force of the world.
*   **Silence:** The absence of Resonance. A corruption that turns the world grey and static.
*   **Soft Ones:** Organic beings (like the Player). Rare, fragile, and "scheduled for disposal" by the machine logic.
*   **The Carillon:** A legendary source of sound/time that has ceased to ring.

## Zones

### Zone 0: The Scrapyard
*   **Description:** The industrial graveyard where broken things are discarded.
*   **Atmosphere:** Rust, smog, halted time.
*   **Key Landmarks:**
    *   **The Junk Pile:** A mountain of discarded gears and "Soft Units".
    *   **The Foreman's Office (Implied):** Where the Ledger is found.
*   **Entities:**
    *   **Serum Bots:** Security automatons.
    *   **Golgotha (Boss):** The Accumulation. A mass of refuse.

### Zone 1: Glass Gardens
*   **Description:** A fragile ecosystem of silica and light.
*   **Atmosphere:** Sharp, crystalline, silent.
*   **Entities:**
    *   **Porcelain Dancers:** Automata that once danced to the Carillon. Now broken.
    *   **Tick-Tock:** The Broken Bard. Obsessed with the rhythm of silence.

## Items & Artifacts
*   **Cracked Mirror:** Shows the world but not the "Soft Ones". Implies the player has no reflection in this metallic reality, or they are a "ghost" in the machine.
*   **Foreman's Ledger:** Documents the disposal of organics. The timestamp "12:00:00" marks the end of history.
